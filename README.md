Degreeeproject in bioinformatics
This is my degreeproject for the experimental and industrial biomedicine program At Link√∂ping University.
The project was started on the 29 of August 2022. and was fininshed by handing in the report on the 19 of december 2022.
The project tackled the undertstand of the cause of non-mosaic women and what change can have caused the 100 to 0 split in X-inactivation and the development of a high-throuput method to detect changes i.e. SNPs and INdels in the X-chromosome.
For further question or lack of documentation please se in the pipeline.sh script and the R-code with comments to se how the figures was made.
 In the folder figures all the Raw figures and graph can be found and the combined version used in the report. 
 The IGV figures are namned after the location of the INdel/SNPs. 
 The Pearls script is split in 2 parts due to it handling two different steps in the form of genotyping and GenomicsDBimport. 
In the syntax of samtools and all the function used in bash the creation of a pointer with spaces in the name will be an issue.
Due to the system being a bit of a sussy thing that wont work as intended due to the space being in the same interaction as a dash or slash leading to bad juju and not working. 


Thank you for taking time and Reading my scripts and checking my figures.
