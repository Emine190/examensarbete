Degreeeproject in bioinformatics
This is my degreeproject for the experimental and industrial biomedicine program At Link√∂ping University.
The project was started on the 29 of August 2022. and was fininshed by handing in the report on the 19 of december 2022.
The project tackled the undertstand of the cause of non-mosaic women and what change can have caused the 100 to 0 split in X-inactivation.
For further question or lakc of documentation please se in the pipeline.sh script and your own understanding.
In the syntax of samtools and all the function used in bash the creation of a pointer with spaces in the name will be an issue.
Due to the system being a bit of a sussy thing that wont work as intended due to the space being in the same interaction as a dash or slash leading to bad juju and not working. 
Example is my/dir/My Book/sample will make the function look in /My/sample and then leading to a failure. 
This can be of greater difficulty when all the code is infested by these pointers that wont work for the function but will work for the Echo.
