The X-chromosome inactivation is a very complicated process that is influenced by multiple loci that are needed to interconncect with the help of the Xist coating to silence the X.
Normally this process will achieve a normaldistribution in wich X is inactivated when surveying a large population of women.
In the X-chromosome there is a region that is called the X-inactivation center(XIC) that is loacated at the the q13 on the X-chromosome.
In this region the Xist-gene is located as well as the promotor gene FTX and the anti-sense gene Tsix and JPX that helps to regulate the inactivation.
In some women the inactivation is skewed or even some are non-mosaic. 
Non-mosaic is the defenition of the same X in all the cells is inactivated. 
Skewed inactivation is the case of one X being favored over the other so it is keept unsilenced in a greater degree.
